# Takeaways & Reflection

Today we've:
* covered how linear least squares is sensitive to outliers,
  but that alternate linear regression methods have some robustness to outliers
* looked at what makes a problem linear, and we are better able to look at an
  application and decide if linear regression may be applicable.
* built on this knowledge to apply linear regression to decomposing multivariate data
  into itâ€™s parts, estimating how much of each part is present
* used unsupervised learning to try and discover what parts may be present in multivariate data.
* used unsupervised learning to find clusters in multivariate data
* appreciated the importance of validation in assessing the performance of a model,
  and in determining if a model may be improved by providing more data.
